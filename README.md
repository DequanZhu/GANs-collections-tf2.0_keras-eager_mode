# Description
> This repository implements all kinds of GAN-models based on tensorflow2.0 keras API and in eager mode.And all the code is based on [this](https://github.com/hwalsuklee/tensorflow-generative-model-collections), i.e. the networks and parameters are same. The code was only validated on windows platform and just cpu mode.


# How to use
> [Install tensorflow2.0-aplha version.](https://tensorflow.google.cn/install/pip)
> Anaconda virtual enviroment is recommended.
> To support GPU mode,please refer to [this](https://tensorflow.google.cn/guide/using_gpu)(I haven't validated on GPU beacuse have no GPU  to use).

# TODO
- [x] To implement ACGAN, EBGAN, BEGAN, etc.
- [x] Support GPU run.
